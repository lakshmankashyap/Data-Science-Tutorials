## Tutorial on How to Handle Missing Data:

Real-world data often has missing values. For example imagine buying a chocolate box with 60 chocolate samples where there are 15 different unique shapes of chocolates. Unfortunately, on   opening the chocolate box, you find two empty segments of chocolate. Now let us ask some questions to ourselves like

  - Can you accurately find a way out off handling the missing chocolate segments?

    Should one just pretend as if the missing chocolate isn’t missing.?
    Should one return the chocolate box to the seller?
    Should one go and buy two other chocolates to fill the missing portion?
    Or can one just predict the shape of the missing chocolate based on previous experience of arrangement and shapes of chocolate in the box and then buy a chocolate of such predicted shape?

Data can have missing values for a number of reasons such as observations that were not recorded and data corruption.Handling missing data is important as many machine learning algorithms do not support data with missing values.

In this kernel tutorial, you will discover how to handle missing data for machine learning with Python.

Specifically, after completing this tutorial you will know:

    How to marking invalid or corrupt values as missing in your dataset.
    How to remove rows with missing data from your dataset.
    How to impute missing values with mean values in your dataset.

Let’s get started.
