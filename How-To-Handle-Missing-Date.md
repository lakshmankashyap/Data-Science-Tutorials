## Tutorial on How to Handle Missing Data:

Real-world data often has missing values. For example imagine you have a dataset of students (boys & girls) in a college. Unfortunately, on previewing the data you find few students height and weight are missing. Now let us ask some questions to ourselves like

  - Can you accurately find a way out off handling the missing heights/ weights?
  - Should one just pretend as if the missing instances isn’t missing.?
  - Should one go and ask those students for their height/ weight? (Not feasible!)
  - Or can one just predict the shape of the missing instances based on previous experience?

Data can have missing values for a number of reasons such as: observations that were not recorded and data corruption. Handling missing data is important as many machine learning algorithms do not support data with missing values.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to handle missing data for machine learning with Python.

Specifically, after goinf through this tutorial you will know:

    How to marking invalid or corrupt values as missing in your dataset.
    How to remove rows with missing data from your dataset.
    How to impute missing values with mean values in your dataset.

Let’s get started.
